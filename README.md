# Simple-Compounding-Interest-Investment-Calculator
A simple compounding interest investment calculator. One of the earliest scripts / programs using Python, it didn't really go anywhere further until I discovered and learned how to use pyinstaller! Now, anyone can use it!

- It allows the calculation of compounding interest by placing in user input variables such as principal deposit amount, interest per annum (%) and duration in no. of years.

1. Download the exe file.
2. Use! Its that simple. 

# How was it compiled / created?
- It was compiled using PyCharm and Pyinstaller. 

# Change Log:
